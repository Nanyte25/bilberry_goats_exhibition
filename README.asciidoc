Waterford City has a rare treasure which is unique in the world, the last of an ancient breed of wild goat called
the Bilberry Goats. They are a landrace and wild species which means that without the freedom to roam on their original
habitat in the Bilberry area, which has particular minerals and vegetation the goats will become extinct.
Waterford’s majestic and beautiful Bilberry Goats who have lived in Waterford city for centuries are now an endangered
species as their habitat is inadequate.

The videos are activated by sensors which register the warmth of the human body.  By engaging and caring about the
Bilberry Goats, the people of Waterford will protect this precious part of their heritage for generations to come.
The video images are fleeting, referencing how precarious Waterford’s Bilberry Goats survival stands at present.
Their original habitat has been reduced to a small piece of rented land which is not adequate for this wild goat species.
This piece of land is highlighted in black in the light projection on the ground.  The area in white is the remainder
of the Bilberry Goats original habitat which they need to roam and graze on, in order to survive.

This work is a collaboration between artist Marie Lee, who painted the animations (marielee2011@gmail.com), and members
of South East Makerspace (SEMS), Aileen Drohan, Paula Kenneally, Dave Kilkenny, David Kirwan and Podge Murphy who have
skills in digital art, coding, engineering, electronics and physics.  SEMS is a club and shared workspace where
creative practitioners can meet to work on individual and joint projects. http://www.southeastmakerspace.org[South East Makerspace]
